      <strong>Bugatti La Voiture Noire Specs</strong><br>
      Building a one-off car for a wealthy client can be incredibly difficult. Thankfully, the Bugatti La Voiture
      Noire specs are built upon a proven Bugatti chassis. Because this car is destined for a private collection, we
      might not see it run a quarter-mile. Given the performance of similar models, we will estimate the
      Bugatti La Voiture Noire 0-60 time of under 3 seconds, with a low-9 second 1/4 mile.

              <strong>Bugatti Noire Buying Tips </strong>Looking for a Veyron to fill that hypercar-sized hole in your
              garage? Here's the good news; it will be
              very
              difficult for you to find a "stinker." The vast majority of Veyrons were bought and owned by moneyed
              individuals who didn't balk at the annual maintenance regimen that could climb into six-figures territory.

              If we were to think about internal combustion engines in a logical manner, more cylinders would mean more
              power. Bugatti resurrected the sixteen-cylinder in a few concepts, and they shocked the world when it
              entered
              production in 2001. To engine designers, there is nothing new under the sun. So they took inspiration from
              the
              Jetta VR6 and simply scaled it up. In general, the W16 engine is two VR8 engines. Essentially they added 4
              cylinders to the W12 found in Bentley, Audi, as well as a few VW models. The Bugatti La Voiture Noire
              engine
              specs are slightly improved than the predecessor by the use of sequential turbochargers. Instead of having
              to
              awaken 4 equally sized turbos simultaneously, the Bugatti La Voiture Noire Engine keeps two smaller
              turbinesspinning and ready to make boost.

        <br><strong><br>Bugatti La Voiture Noire Transmission</strong>
      <p>Before the return of Bugatti, no transmission capable of holding such power had been conceived. So it
        took the
        Formula 1 masters at Ricardo to built a new 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The dry-sump system has multiple
        cooling circuits and it sends power to a multi-plate rear differential. The front end is controlled by a
        Haldex unit, similar to what Lamborghini and Audi use. With the Bugatti La Voiture Noire making 1,479
        horsepower, Ricardo decided to demand the very best from their suppliers. Each component has been tested
        to
        destruction to ensure years of worry-free shifting. Regardless of your feelings about the dual-clutch
        transmission, it makes perfect sense in this application. The potency of the brand is clearly evident in
        the
        Bugatti La Voiture Noire.</p>
      <strong>Bugatti La Voiture Noire Interior</strong>
      <p>

        Stephan Winkelmann, President of Bugatti describes the Bugatti La Voiture Noire interior as the most
        comfortable car ever produced. It is a coupe that feels like a limousine. The symmetrical layout and
        ergonomic
        controls will prevent anxiety when cruising at 250 mph. It took countless hours to combine inspiration
        from
        the past with the latest in safety and connectivity. Leather and machined metals are combined to create
        the
        perfect atmosphere for the owner. Nothing is left to chance, as the seats, pedals, and controls are
        measured
        and fitted to the owner.</p>
      <strong>Bugatti La Voiture Noire Brakes</strong>
      <p>

        If you really need to stop, you should consider AP Racing. They engineered the Bugatti La Voiture Noire
        specs
        to allow for 249-0 mph in 10 seconds. The massive rotors measure 16.5” front and 15.7” outback. Although
        they
        have considered the idea of titanium calipers, the Bugatti La Voiture Noire brakes are 8-piston front and
        6
        piston rear. Each piston is a unique size to maximize the swept area. Using a few aerodynamic tricks, the
        front rotor heat shields create a turbine effect, increasing downforce at cruising speeds. Because the
        carbon-ceramic discs were designed to last the life of the car, the brake pads are your only point of
        wear.
      </p>

      <strong>Bugatti La Voiture Noire Standout Features</strong>
      <p>

        Everything about this car stands out. The name translates to "The Black Car", because it was inspired by a
        car
        that disappeared at the beginning of WWII. The body is meant to look like a solid sculpture, and it is
        able to
        hold more lateral G force than any other Bugatti. Both bumpers are made of carbon fiber and integrated
        into
        the body. Covering the engine is a gorgeous deck lid perforated in an art-deco style. The wheels and tires
        are
        specific to this car, with the silver spokes appearing longer by being painted on the sidewall. It is a
        blast
        from the past and also a statement to the world. Bugatti is capable of making your dreams come true. </p>
