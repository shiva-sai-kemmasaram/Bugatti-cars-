            <strong></strong>First displayed in concept form at the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show, the Veyron came to fruition
            as something of a technical exercise for Volkswagen AG, showcasing its capabilities through the production
            of one of the world’s most capable road-going machines.

            Volkswagen’s acquisition of the Bugatti name in 1998 sparked the creation of multiple outlandish concepts,
            the two-door EB 118, four-door EB 218 and the more recognisable 18/3 Chiron, all with a proposed 6.3-litre,
            545bhp W18. The latter was the world’s first glimpse at the Veyron, with it later becoming the 16/4 Veyron
            concept before morphing into the production car we see today.

            Bugatti has only been around for a couple of decades in its current form, founded in 1998 following the
            Volkswagen Group acquisition. The marque's history goes much further than this, though, with the badge first
            making an appearance 111 years ago in 1909, when it was founded by none other than Jean and Ettore Bugatti.

            The brand showed initial promise, producing machines for both the road and track more capable than most cars
            of the time – the first ever Monaco Grand Prix, held in 1929, was won by William Grover-Williams in a
            Bugatti Type 35B, and the brand even held two Le Mans wins to its name.

              Despite what the numbers might lead you to believe, the Veyron’s cabin is more akin to a Bentley’s than a
              car designed for outright top speed. Exquisite leather upholstery (complemented by a healthy dose of
              carbon fibre, of course), a comfortable door aperture and even a rear-view mirror-mounted reversing camera
              display all make it a surprisingly liveable machine.

              An example as to just how far Bugatti took the 'no-expenses-spared' approach, would be the indicator
              stalks, famously costing as much as some small hatchbacks, machined from a single piece of
              aluminium/magnesium alloy - even the gear shift paddles are made from magnesium. The centre console is
              also derived from a single piece of aluminium, featuring guilloché finishing, a reference to the technique
              used on exposed surfaces of Bugatti’s early engines.

      <b>Rivals</b>
      <p>
        Porsche’s Carrera GT and the Pagani Zonda F were perhaps the Veyron’s closest rivals, but in reality, it’s
        difficult to compare the Bugatti to anything of its time. All-wheel-drive, turbochargers and substantial weight
        set it apart from the lightweight, naturally-aspirated duo, but the Veyron’s straight line performance and
        outright refinement simply couldn’t be matched.

        In a modern context the field has opened up somewhat, not least because Veyron money is in the ballpark for any
        number of other iconic supercars and hypercars, including the full back-catalogue of top-end Ferraris like the
        F40, F50 and Enzo, plus the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder and Ferrari LaFerrari. The number of cars now coming
        close to matching what Bugatti was able to achieve but with significantly less weight and more driver
        involvement is quite impressive.
      <p><b><br>The special editions</b><br>

        The Bugatti Veyron has been with us for almost 15 years now, and in that time there’s been an unseemly amount of
        special editions to help shift the steeply-priced supercar. It seems for £1million-plus, buyers crave
        uniqueness, opening the doors to a selection of questionably painted and garishly upholstered specials. Below
        are the most notable of them all.
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 (2005) </b><br>

        The original Veyron became the world’s fastest production car after it achieved a top speed of 253mph. The car
        features an 8.0-litre, quad-turbo W16 which produces 987bhp and 922lb ft of torque. Development for the car
        started way back in 2001 and each car has reportedly cost Bugatti around £5million to produce, but being sold
        for less than £1million, each car was sold at a significant loss. 300 produced. <br>
        <b> <br>Bugatti Veyron Pur Sang (2007)</b><br>

        Introduced at the Paris motor show the Pur Sang (which translates as thoroughbred) was limited to a run of five
        cars and features high-gloss bronze wheels and a clear body finish to reveal the Veyron’s silver oxide and
        carbonfibre body.
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron Fbg Par Hermes (2008)</b><br>

        Produced in association with the French style house (famed for its leather goods) the car features a Hermes
        monogram on the front grille, wheels with a single ‘H’ in the centre, and a fuel filler cap engraved with
        ‘Bugatti Veyron Fbg Par Hermes’.
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron Sang Noir (2008)</b><br>

        Based on the ‘Pur Sang’, the ‘Sang Noir’ (black blood), features an all-black exterior finish paired with a
        bright orange interior. Just 15 examples were produced.
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport (2008)</b><br>

        Unveiled at Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, this targa top version of the Veyron can hit the same 253mph top
        speed as the coupe with the removable hard-top roof fitted, but is limited to 229mph with the roof down. Chassis
        no.001 was sold at Auction, raising 900,000 US dollars for charity. 150 are set to be made.
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport (2008)</b><br>

        The car was designed at the request of a UK client. It was finished in a unique matte pearlescent white with
        black front grille, exhaust and engine cover.
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport (2011)</b><br>

        After numerous special editions based on the standard car, the Super Sport boasts an enhanced output of 1183bhp
        and 1106lb ft of torque. The car was designed to retake the world speed record for a production car, after SSC’s
        Ultimate Aero had beaten the standard car’s top speed. The Super Sport hit a faintly ridiculous 268mph in the
        hands of Bugatti test driver Pierre Henri Raphanel. The launch version of the car included the ‘World Record
        Edition’, which was finished in bare carbon fibre with a bright orange contrast.
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport by Bijan Pakzad (2011)</b><br>

        Before unexpectedly passing away, the Iranian born fashion designer collaborated to design this one-off Veyron.
        The car features a fairly questionable colour scheme, combining the unlikely hues yellow and chrome. One of the
        most garish special editions, and that is before you notice the handwritten-look ‘Bijan’ scrawled on the
        underside of the rear wing…
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron Super Sport Sang Noir (2011)</b><br>

        Introduced for customers who did not like the look of the ‘World Record Edition’. The car, as the name suggests,
        is finished entirely in black. A bright orange interior awaited the owners who paid a massive 3.4million dollars
        for it…
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport L’or Blanc (2011)</b><br>

        Another collaboration with a design company, this time with Konigliche Porzellan-Manufatur Berlin – a porcelain
        maker. The car is finished in a more psychedelic than elegant blue and white swirled pattern, while the wheel
        badges, fuel and oil filler caps and the signature ‘EB’ badge at the rear are all made of porcelain. As you do.
        <br><b><br>Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Middle East Edition (2011)</b><br>

        The three different ‘Middle East Edition’ cars were unveiled at the 2011 Dubai motor show. The first car
        combines a bright yellow body with black carbon inserts and black wheels. The second has a two-tone body with
        blue carbon framed in polished aluminium. The final Grand Sport features a more tasteful green carbon finish,
        once again framed with polished aluminium. Prices from £1.4million.
