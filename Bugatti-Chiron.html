        <p>For the 1999 and 2015 concept car and the car that originates this design, see Bugatti 18/3 Chiron and Bugatti Vision Gran  <br> The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron, the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016. The car's design was initially previewed with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show.

          The car is named after the Monégasque driver Louis Chiron. The car shares the name with the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car.  <!-- <button type="button" class="card-btn" href="#">kiiioii</button> -->

                  The 2022 Chiron isn't only the ultimate Bugatti, it's the ultimate car. Period. This $3 million work of art is capable of pummeling the pavement at over 200 mph thanks to a 16-cylinder engine that features four turbochargers and cranks out at least 1500 horsepower—the more expensive Super Sport model is even more powerful. The Chiron's cabin is just as artfully designed as its exterior, and it coddles occupants in fine materials that help justify its price tag. But let's be honest, people are really paying for the performance here. Those looking for modern conveniences (think Apple CarPlay) or driver-assistance tech, they won't find them here, but after driving this monster, they likely won't care about such minor drawbacks.     </div>

                <div class="accordion-body">At the 2017 IAA show in Frankfurt, Bugatti announced that the Chiron broke the record of fastest 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) acceleration time, completing it in 41.96 seconds in a span of 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) at the Ehra-Lessien high-speed oval on a weekend in August 2017.[68] The car was driven by Colombian racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya.[69][70][71]

                  Bugatti also added an extra livery to the Chiron on display to confirm that it was the same car that broke the 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) record.[72] During the show, Bugatti also mentioned that during the run, the car accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.1 seconds, 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.1 seconds, and 0–400 km/h (0–248.5 mph) in 32.6 seconds, which altogether, also makes the Chiron faster than its predecessor, the Veyron.[72]
                  
                  The record has since been broken by the Koenigsegg Regera and other vehicles.

                  <strong></strong> Bugatti has only been around for a couple of decades in its current form, founded in 1998 following the Volkswagen Group acquisition. The marque's history goes much further than this, though, with the badge first making an appearance 111 years ago in 1909, when it was founded by none other than Jean and Ettore Bugatti.
                  
                  The brand showed initial promise, producing machines for both the road and track more capable than most cars of the time – the first ever Monaco Grand Prix, held in 1929, was won by William Grover-Williams in a Bugatti Type 35B, and the brand even held two Le Mans wins to its name.

            <p><br>
                <b><br>Specifications and performance</b><br>
                The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L; 487.8 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103.25 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less power.

                Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system.[16][17][18] The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.
                
                The Chiron can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0-200 km/h (0-124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0-300 km/h (0-186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.
                
                The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375-380 km/h (233-236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as Bugatti concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving.Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its limited top speed.Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg-imp; 10.45 mpg-US).          </p>
            <p><b><br>Bugatti Veyron Sales </b> <br>
              The first 200 cars were sold before the first was delivered. The base price is €2,400,000 and buyers were required to place a €200,000 deposit before their purchase.[24] The first three Chiron were delivered to their owners in Europe and the Middle East in March 2017.[26] In January 2022, every Chiron had been sold, although as of January 2022, not all have been manufactured.    <br><br>
                If that last statement is remotely shocking to you, I advise you consider investing in a different hypercar. Maintaining a Veyron is notoriously costly; regular service can run in around the $25,000 mark; having a new set of tires fitted cost close to $50,000, as you had to ship the car back to France to make the swap.</p>
