                  <strong></strong> Bugatti has only been around for a couple of decades in its current form, founded in 1998 following the Volkswagen Group acquisition. The marque's history goes much further than this, though, with the badge first making an appearance 111 years ago in 1909, when it was founded by none other than Jean and Ettore Bugatti.
                  
                  The brand showed initial promise, producing machines for both the road and track more capable than most cars of the time – the first ever Monaco Grand Prix, held in 1929, was won by William Grover-Williams in a Bugatti Type 35B, and the brand even held two Le Mans wins to its name.

                <b><br>Bugatti Divo Highlights</b><br>
It's difficult to overstate the impact the Bugatti Veyron had on the collective car consciousness. Many ragged on the Veyron for its conquest of the mighty McLaren F1's longstanding record, considering the Bugatti is considerably heavier, more complex, and more luxurious than the McLaren. But like the McLaren F1, the Veyron emerged as one of the landmark cars of history. The Veyron represented a quantum leap forward in what we thought was possible; here was a 1,000-hp landbound ballistic missile with a top speed of 253 mph and an interior as luxurious as a Bentley's, all while remaining as drivable and docile as a high-end Audi.
            </p>
            <p><b><br>Bugatti Divo Buying Tips </b> <br>
                Looking for a Veyron to fill that hypercar-sized hole in your garage? Here's the good news; it will be very difficult for you to find a "stinker." The vast majority of Veyrons were bought and owned by moneyed individuals who didn't balk at the annual maintenance regimen that could climb into six-figures territory.
                <br><br>
                If that last statement is remotely shocking to you, I advise you consider investing in a different hypercar. Maintaining a Veyron is notoriously costly; regular service can run in around the $25,000 mark; having a new set of tires fitted cost close to $50,000, as you had to ship the car back to France to make the swap.</p>
